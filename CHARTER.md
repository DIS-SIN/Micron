## Project Charter

This project is intended to serve as an experiment in distruption and the potentials of a digital public service. These applications, no matter how polished they may look, are not being actively maintained by a formalized team. These projects are usually dreamt up, designed, built, tested, deployed, and verified by 1-2 curious and keen public servants.

## Project Goal(s)
* Serve as a basic building block for other developers to use
* Act as a training ground for our developers to make something real with the tools and technology we are investigating or evaluating
* Demonstrate the power of working in the open, leveraging the community and developer progress world wide to provide Canadians with an experience that meets the demands of a mobile and highly connected citizenry.
* Demonstrate to the world the Canadian Public Service is serious about digital transformation and is actively thinking and working on building the digital future

## Key Project Milestone(s)

What key milestones will this project endeavour to meet:
* Stand a basic Survey Response "Tap Out" up in 24 hours or less
* Developer is comfortable building modern responsive sites in Python/Flask/JSON/JQuery
* A clean usable template for a basic Survey Response tool is created as a downloadable asset
* Developer will have gained experience debugging and running into roadblocks, and how to resolve
* Developer will have created a resource(s) to help other interested parties replicate their work (skill sharing)
* Developers will have worked through multiple branches on git and merging two different areas (front end/back end)
* Developers will have found ways to pair program remotely with efficiency

##  Key Project Timeline(s)

How much effort will the developer aim to spend:
* This is aimed to be a rapid build, with a minimal time-to-value
* Max allotment 2 business days

This project aims to run in the following window:
* 1st working UI shell compiling, Day 1
* 1st working Backend shell, Day 1
* Full operational web app with front end, middle, and back end stubs, Day 2
* Deploy working sample app to github, Day 2
* Commentary, cleanups, documentation, Day 2
* Bug fixes, code review, infosharing, next steps, Day 2
* Shelving complete package, minor housekeeping updates, Day 2+ (this is the indefinite phase, a project may sit in the hangar for a long time, but the intention is to be able to spin back up quickly with the content maintained)
