# General Development Information

Micron is build in Python, Flask, and uses jQuery and JSON to handle the front end work. The backend is a lightweight db which stores the answers to our questions. The tool can support multiple surveys with n questions. 

The tool is also languified on the client side, so the user an switch between languages on the fly.

This project helped us learn how to work better as a team using github, and gave us more practice in division of labor and each developer working on different parts in parallel.
